## Overview

This firewall is a **self-hosted, modular firewall** written in Rust.  

The project currently focuses on **host-based packet sniffing and filtering** with a roadmap toward **kernel-level gateway firewalling**.

---

## Goals

1. **Learn real networking and security**
2. **Learn Rust**
3. **Create a modular and maintainable firewall**
4. **Bridge user-space and kernel-space packet processing**
5. **Understand defensive and offensive techniques** through controlled testing
